#####As time goes,
#####I couldn't find anything
#####That I could know,
#####
#####Who am I?
#####Or what am I?
#####
#####I don't know.
#####
#####Maybe I could know myself
#####Of the chrysalis,
#####The chrysalis of my self,
#####My life, or My
#####Philosophie.
#####
#####No matter,
#####Everybody's life going on,
#####So am I.
#####
#####Back to the ground,
#####Time will go on,
#####And my philosophie will do so.
