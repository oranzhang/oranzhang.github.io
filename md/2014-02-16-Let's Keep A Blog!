### The Reason Why I Pick Up a Blog Again
I can still remember the day I built up my first *Blog*, it was based on WordPress and I gave up it for my blahblah...Afterwards I built many blogs, some had only one article, some had more than one, but all were forgetten by me and got lost in the wave of Internet.

I didn't continue my blogs after that.

But I am still of a dream of having my *OWN* blog, A blog for logging my feels, my thoughts, my minds... and my life.

So I didn't continue my blogs until now. And the blog it what you are staring at.

### To me that used to be *ためらう*
ためらう is used for describing a man who is `Hesitant`, and it's what I used to be, And may I will be what I want be.

It seems that Hesitantion was a big problem to me, it made things worse and worse, I never want to be worst.

###What to store in this blog
As is motioned, here stores my feels, my thoughts, my minds, my life. They are not all, I will put anything I have discovered as Programming, Designing, &c..

###The end
This is the first post, and never be the last post. Hello, my new day, let's keep a blog together!

This time, shall I say `Hello World`?
